# Problem - There are six pirates who must divide $300 among themselves. The division is to proceed as follows. The senior
pirate proposes a way to divide the money. Then the pirates vote.  If the senior pirate gets at least half the votes he wins,
and that division remains. If he doesn't then the next senior-most pirate gets a chance to propose the division.  Now tell
what happens and why(how many pirates survive and how the division is done)? All the pirates are intelligent and the first
priority is to stay alive and the next priority is to get as much money as possible.


# Answer -

Here is how the division is done. The head pirate divides the money evenly between himself and a majority of the next-in-line pirates.  
Then the head pirate survives as do all the others because the pirates that got no money could not vote to reject
the division because they are not a majority.  This is the optimal outcome.  

# Problem 55 - Same as above except the pie is one dollar and is not divisible.

Here is how the division is done. The head pirate gives all the money to any one pirate. And even if he keeps all the 
money he still gets killed because no one wants that. But he gets killed because all but 
that pirates do not like the division.  This cycle will continue until all the pirates but one are dead, the one lowest
on the totem pole.

An alternative is that all the pirates see what will happen if they look out for only themselves, they will all be killed save 
one. So they might decide to keep whatever division the first pirate give out and make that pirate take them all out
for beer.
