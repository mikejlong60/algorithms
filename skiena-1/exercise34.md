# Problem - How many piano tuners are there in the entire world?
## Approach:
  1. Estimate the population of your state versus the population of your county.
  2. Estimate the number of piano tuners in your county.
  3. Use that ratio to determine the number of piano tuners in your state's population and apply that to the whole United States population.
  4. Determine the number of people who live in developing countries and give them a piano tuner rate of 1/4 the US rate.
  5. Apply these rates to determine world piano tuner population.
