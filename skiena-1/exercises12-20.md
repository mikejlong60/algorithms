  1-12. Prove by induction that Sigma n, i=1 --- i=(n(n+1)/2 for n >= 0
     Answer: Base Case n = 0 ---- 0(1)/2 == 0
                  Case n + 1 --- 1(2)/2 == 1  and i == 1 - Proved
                  Case n + 2 --- 2(3)/2 == 3  and i == 3 - proved

  1-13. Prove by induction that Sigma n, i=1 --- i^2 == n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6
      Answer: Base case n = 0 --- 0(1)(1)/6 == 0 and i == 0^2 - Proved
                   case n = 1 --- 1(2)(2+1)/6 == 1 and i == 1^2 - Proved
                   case n = 2 --- 2(3)(3 + 1)/6 == 4 and 4 == 2^2  Proved

  1-14. Prove by induction that Sigma n, i=1 --- i^3 == n^2(n + 1)^2/4
       Answer: Base case n = 0 --- 0(1)^2/4 == 0/4 == 0 - Proved
               Base case n = 1 --- 1(2)^2/4 == 1 - Proved
               Base case n = 2 --- (9 * 4)/4 == 9 -- i^2 is 8.  This algorithm is not correct

  1-16. Prove by induction that on n >= 1 that for every a != 1,
     a^i = a^(n_1) - 1/a-11
