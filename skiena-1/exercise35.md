# Problem - How many gas stations are in the United States?
## Approach:
  1. Estimate the population of your county versus the population of your state.
  2. Estimate the number of gas stations in your county.
  3. Use that ratio to determine the number of gas stations in your state's population and apply that to the whole United States population.
