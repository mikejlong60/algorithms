	//shows another valid schedule: j2 and j1. The algorithm I used was based upon
	//the greedy rule that chooses the earliest finisher and eliminates the
	//conflicting jobs, and then chooses the next earliest finisher.
	//Some caveats:
	//1. I have adjusted the beginning and ending times from the AM/PM times in the book to use a 24 hour clock.
	//2. In the event that a Timeslot goes into the next day I added 24 hours to the ending time.  I reasoned
	//   this is the way Airlines determine start and finish times for a flight.  And also reasoned that
	//   the task of creating a schedule must occur from a starting point, say 0:00 on the 24 hr clock. It makes
	//   no sense to schedule a job as starting in the past.  This is a monotonic clock.
