The Problem:
Given a directed graph of edges that represent paths on map give a polynomial time solution that will
find the shortest path to every node in the graph from a given node.  Include a function f that
determines the distance of an edge based upon a given input.
Solution:
Algorithm efficiency O(n)

This is the dijkstra algorithm for determining shortest path for a directed path from a given node
to every other node with a nuance on each edge that the edge contains a function that determines the
distance based upon a constant integer for all the edges.
