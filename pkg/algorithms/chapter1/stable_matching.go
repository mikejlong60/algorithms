//This algorithm accommodates both weak and strong instabilities.

//Definition of Instability - For a given married woman, does a man exist that she prefers over her current husband who also prefers her over his current wife.
//Given that definition of instability there can be no lying about preferences for a woman because a man can only propose once to a woman
//and that woman has to decide if that man is more preferred than her current husband on her list. It's a contradiction to expect that
//the preference list of the woman is ever disregarded. That would mean some matches would be unstable because a woman would be married to a man
//that violated the definition of a stable match given above.
