# Problem - How many miles of road are in the United States?
## Approach:
  1. Randomly choose 30 square mile grids in the United states using a Google map.
    30 is a magic number from statistics that designates a large statistical sample.
  2. Determine the sum of road length for each grid.
  2. Average that number to determine average road distance per square mile.
  3. Multiply that number by the number of square miles in the United States.
